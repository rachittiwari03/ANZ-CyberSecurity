## ANZ-CyberSecurity-Virtual-Experience


## Task 1 â€“ Investigate E-mails sent in and report suspicious item. 
Social Engineering Investigation: I conducted an investigation into social engineering by examining multiple emails and creating an analysis report based on my findings.


Summary: You have a task to investigate a number of emails and determine if they are dangerous or safe. If you find any harmful content, you should write a short report explaining why it's dangerous. The email guidelines provided help you identify and avoid phishing scams, which are attempts to trick you into revealing personal information through fake messages. You can verify the authenticity of ANZ websites by checking for SSL Certificates. It's important to be cautious with emails asking for personal or security information, regularly update passwords, keep antivirus software up to date, and contact ANZ's Customer Service Centre if you're unsure about an email.

Explanation: Your assignment involves examining a set of emails and determining if they are harmful or not. If you come across any emails that seem suspicious or potentially dangerous, you need to write a brief report explaining why they are risky. The guide also provides information on phishing, which is a type of scam where someone tries to trick you into giving away your personal information and security details by pretending to be a trustworthy source. These phishing emails often include instructions to click on a link and provide your personal information.

To ensure that a website is legitimate and associated with ANZ, there are a couple of checks you can perform. Firstly, look at the address bar of your browser and see if the website address changes from "http://" to "https://". The "https://" indicates that the website has a Socket Layer (SSL) Certificate, which helps secure your information. Secondly, check for a security icon near the address bar, such as a lock or key symbol. Clicking on this icon will provide you with more information about the SSL Certificate, confirming the authenticity of the ANZ website.

To minimize the risk of falling victim to a phishing scam, follow these precautions: treat any email requesting personal or security information with caution, as ANZ will not ask for this information via email; regularly change your passwords for online accounts; keep your antivirus and firewall software up to date and perform regular scans on your computer.

If you are unsure about the legitimacy of an email claiming to be from ANZ, it is recommended to contact the ANZ Customer Service Centre before following any instructions or clicking on any links provided in the email. They can verify the authenticity of the email and provide further guidance.




## Task 2 - Analyse a Packet Capture file using an open source tool to identify and investigate any potential threats.
Digital Investigation: I examined the packet traffic by using Wireshark and HxD Hex Editor to identify and investigate any potential threats related to file types.


Summary: Suspicious network activity has been detected from a user on the ANZ network. A laptop has triggered security alerts due to unusual internet traffic. Your task is to investigate the network traffic and determine what the user accessed and downloaded. You have been given a packet capture file (pcap) containing their recent network activity. Your goal is to identify and report any relevant information or artifacts found in the packet capture file. A comprehensive report detailing your findings and the steps taken is required.

Explanation: There has been a discovery of suspicious activity originating from a user within the ANZ network. The security systems flagged a laptop due to abnormal internet traffic patterns, and your assistance is required to investigate further. Your main objective is to analyze the user's network activity and determine what websites, files, or information they accessed and downloaded.

To aid in your investigation, you have been provided with a packet capture file (pcap). This file contains a record of all the user's recent network activity, including the data packets transmitted and received. Within this packet capture file, there may be various artifacts or pieces of evidence that can help shed light on the user's actions.

Your task is to meticulously examine the packet capture file, identifying and documenting any relevant findings. This could include information such as websites visited, files downloaded, or any other activities that may indicate suspicious behavior. It is crucial that you provide a comprehensive report summarizing your discoveries and the steps you took during the investigation.
